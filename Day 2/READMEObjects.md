## Exercises Objects

### Beginner

1. Create a class `Book` with properties `title` and `author`, and a method to display the book's details.
2. Create a private property `#price` in the `Product` class and add methods to get and set the price.
3. Implement a `Person` class with a method that returns the person's full name using a traditional function.
4. Create a class `Phone` with a static method that returns a list of supported models.
5. Implement a class `Computer` with an arrow function method that logs the model and year.

### Intermediate

1. Create a class `User` with a private property `#password`. Implement methods to validate and update the password.
2. Extend a `Vehicle` class to create a `Truck` class. Use `super()` to call the parent constructor and add truck-specific properties.
3. Create a `House` class and define a method that uses an arrow function to log details about the house.
4. Implement a class `Employee` that inherits from a `Person` class. Override a method using `super()` to include additional details.
5. Build a class `Gadget` with both public and private properties. Include methods that demonstrate the difference between traditional and arrow functions for accessing properties.

### Advanced

1. Create a class hierarchy where `Vehicle` is the base class, and `Car` and `Bike` are derived classes. Use `super()` and private properties effectively.
2. Implement a class `BankAccount` with private properties for balance and methods for deposit, withdrawal, and balance inquiry. Include validation checks.
3. Create a system where a `User` class has methods that utilize `this` in both traditional and arrow functions. Demonstrate how context affects method behavior.
4. Design a class `Organization` that contains a nested structure of departments. Use methods and properties to calculate overall budget allocation.
5. Build a real-world example like a shopping cart system using classes, private properties, inheritance, and method overriding. Implement context-sensitive features using `this` and arrow functions.
